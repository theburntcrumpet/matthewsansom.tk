            <h2>Software was my first love. Software will be my last.</h2>
            <p>My name is Matthew Sansom. I am a 23-year-old software developer from Nottinghamshire. 
                I've worked in the tech industry for over 5 years, and over 2 of those 
                were spent developing software. For the next year, I'll be studying Computing and IT with the Open University
                on a full-time basis in order to complete my degree, whilst actively seeking freelance work. Software isn't just a career choice for me. It is also a hobby.
                Much of my spare time is spent tinkering with Linux distros, Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's and reading books about software and hardware.</p>
            <p>During the course of my Open University degree, I've also been exposed to Java. In my spare time, I've had exposure to game engines such as Unity.</p>
